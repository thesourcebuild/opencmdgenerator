<#
.SYNOPSIS
Creates a shareable release package.

.DESCRIPTION
Produces dist/<version>/ containing everything a recipient needs and nothing they
do not: the web app as a static zip, the Windows installer, a SHA256SUMS.txt so the
download can be verified, and a RELEASE.md explaining each file. Copy or upload that
folder, or pass -Zip for a single archive.

electron-builder's own output also contains win-unpacked and build intermediates -
several hundred megabytes of unpacked Electron runtime - so it works in a staging
directory outside the repo and only the installers are collected. That also sidesteps
antivirus locking the extracted Electron binaries, which otherwise fails with
"EPERM: rename ... win-unpacked.tmp".

.PARAMETER Source
Package the source: a buildable archive of the project.

.PARAMETER Binary
Package the built artifacts: the web static zip and the Windows installer.

.PARAMETER Release
Both of the above - the complete set you would attach to a release. This is the
default when none of the three is given.

.PARAMETER Verify
Run tests, typecheck and lint first, and stop if any fail. Use this for anything you
actually intend to share.

.PARAMETER NoBuild
Package existing build output instead of rebuilding. Fails if it is missing.

.PARAMETER Arch
Architectures to build installers for. Default x64. Ignored for -Target web.

.PARAMETER OutDir
Base output directory. Default: dist/ at the repo root. The release lands in
<OutDir>/<version>/.

.PARAMETER StagingDir
Where electron-builder works. Default: a versioned folder in TEMP.

.PARAMETER Zip
Also produce OpenCmdGenerator-<version>.zip containing the whole release folder.

.PARAMETER Version
Overrides the version. Default: the root `version` file.
